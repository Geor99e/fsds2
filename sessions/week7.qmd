title: "Textual Data"
---

## Overview

Although the direct use of textual (both structured and unstructured) data is still relatively rare in spatial analyses, the growth of crowd-sourced and user-generated content points to the growing importance of this area. he tools and approaches in this area are also evolving quickly and changing rapidly, so this week is intended primarily to familiarise you with the basic landscape in preparation for you developing your skills further in your own time!

## Learning Outcomes

1. An awareness of the benefits of separating content from presentation. 
2. A basic understanding of pattern-matching in Python (you will have been exposed to this Week 2 of CASA0005)
3. A basic understanding of how text can be 'cleaned' to make it more amenable for analysis
4. An appreciation of parallelisation in the context of text processing.
5. An appreciation of how text can be analysed.
:::

The manipulation of text requires a high level of abstraction -- of thinking about words as data in ways that are deeply counter-intuitive -- but the ability to do forms a critical bridge between this block and the subsequent one, while also reinforcing the idea that numerical, spatial, and textual data analyses provide alternative (and often complementary) views into the data.

## Practical

:::{.callout-warning}

## Changes before 22/23

- [ ] Point to cross-module content/recaps.
- [ ] Make link between videos+readings and practical *explicit*.

:::

In the practical we will continue to work with the InsideAirbnb data, here focussing on the third 'class' of data in the data set: text. We will see how working with text is more complex than working with numeric or spatial data and, consequently, why the computational costs rise accordingly. This practical should suggest some new lines of inquiry for [Data+Policy Briefing](../assessments/briefing.qmd).

## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Applying simple regular expressions to find patterns in text.
- How to clean text in preparation for further analysis.
- Simple transformations that allow you to analyse text (e.g. TF/IDF)
- Ways of exploring groups/similarity in textual data.
