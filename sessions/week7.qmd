title: "Spatial Data"
week: 7

## Overview

This week we will be focussing on the use of the geopandas library for spatial data analysis and management through a focus on spatial data and its distribution(s). Geopandas will help to clarify how Object-Oriented design and inheritance processes work, while also allowing to interrogate and map the assigned data set(s). A critical concept that should be emerging here is that spatial and numerical data analyses are, fundamentally, just two different views of the same data.

## Learning Outcomes

1. You develop better *judgement* about interpreting and representing data.
2. You understand how GeoPandas *extends* Pandas with spatial functionality.
3. You build on material covered in Week 1-3, and 5 of CASA0005 to extend your understanding of mapping and spatial data.
4. You develop better *practices* for (spatial) data exploration.
::: 

So we're going to be looking at both how to work geo-data in Python *and* how to explore a real-world data set using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Exploratory *Spatial* Data Analysis (ESDA) approaches to mapping distributions, testing for NaNs, and so on.

## Connections

We're focussing this week on the links between the data you're working with and the process you're trying to study! You might (quite reasonably) assume that these line up nicely, but in the era of big data that isn't the case. 'Accidental' data [@arribas2014accidental] such as smartcard, mobile, web traffic, etc. are *only* ever partial accounts of messy human reality, so we want you to *think* about the gap between what you have and what you want to study.

## Practical

In the practical we will continue to work with the InsideAirbnb data, here focussing on the second 'class' of data in the data set: geography. We will see how to use GoePandas and PySAL for (geo)visualisation and analysis.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Creating/working with geo-data in Python.
- Making maps with Python.
- Exploring the data visually.
- 
:::

To access the practical:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
#| code-fold: false

prac = "Practical-07-Spatial_Data"

print("1. [Preview]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".html)")
print("2. [Download]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".ipynb)")

```
