## Overview

This week we will dig into data (lists and dictionaries) in greater detail so that you understand how we design structures to store and organise data to simplify our analysis. We will also look at how frequently-used code can be packaged up in functions and libraries. This is the point at which we begin to engage with code in a more abstract way because we are increasingly interested in reusability and flexibility.

::: {.callout-important}
## Learning Objectives

1. To see how 'simple' concepts can be (re)combined to tackle complex problems.
2. To develop an understanding of code re-use through functions.
3. To develop an appreciation of the utility of packages and namespaces.
::: 

This week we also start to move beyond Code Camp, so although you should recognise many of the _parts_ that we discuss,  you'll see that we begin to put them together in a new way. The next two weeks are a critical transition between content that you might have seen before in Code Camp (see [Practical](#practical)) or other introductory materials, and the 'data science' approach.

## Practical

:::{.callout-warning}

## Changes before 22/23

- [ ] Point to cross-module content/recaps.
- [ ] Make link between videos+readings and practical *explicit*.

:::

This week's practical will take you through the use of dictionaries and introduce the concept of 'nested' data structures. We'll also be looking at how functions (and variables) can be collected into resuable packages that we can either make ourselves or draw on a worldwide bank of experts -- I know who _I'd_ rather depend on when the opportunity arises!

However, if you have *not yet completed Code Camp* (or were not aware of it!), then you will benefit *enormously* from tackling **Notebooks 6, 8, 9, and 10**. You can either:

1. Follow the instructions for running these [in Google's Collaboratory](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/req/code_camp.html); or 
2. Download the `Raw` files from the [Code Camp Repository](https://github.com/kingsgeocomp/code-camp) on GitHub.

**Note:** there is an issue with the GeoJSON tasks in Notebooks 8 and 9. We can discuss in the Class.

## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Comparing the use of Python lists and dictionaries to store tabular data.
- Extending lists and dictionaries into nested data structures.
- Beginning to make use of packages to access/interact with data.
