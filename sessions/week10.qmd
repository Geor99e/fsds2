## Connections

While I expect most of you will be focussed on assessments, you should *seriously* consider returning to these readings over the term break as they will help you to *reflect* on what you've learned this term -- in this module and across the programme as a whole -- in terms of the direction of the field, the opportunities in industry, and the kinds of work that people with (sptial) data science skills can do.
