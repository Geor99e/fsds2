title: "Visualising Data"
---

## Overview

This week is focussed on formalising our understanding of two things that we've already touched on at multiple points throughout the term: 1) how to link data sets; 2) how to tune matplotlib plots to 'publication quality' by tweaking fine-grained elements. So this week begins by looking at how to join data together in both spatial and non-spatial contexts, before facing off with the monster that most Python visualisation libraries ultimately depend on: matplotlib. As a tool it is both incredibly powerful and intensely counter-intuitive if you are used to R's ggplot. We will also be looking more widely to the future of quantitative methods, the potential of a *geographic* data science, and the ways in which we can move between spatial and non-spatial paradigms of analysis within the same piece of work.

## Learning Outcomes

1. You have formalised your understanding of how to link data in Python.
2. You have broadened your thinking about the purpose of data visualisation.
3. You are thinking about the final project.

### Lectures

You are *strongly* advised to watch these videos on linking data and spatial data, as well how to group data within pandas; *however*, you will not be asked to present any of these because our attention is now on the final assessments. As well, you should by now be familiar with the concept of how to join data from the GIS module ([CASA0005](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/)), so this focusses on two things: 1) how to *do* this in Python; and 2) how to approach this process with large or mismatched data sets.

You may also want to look at the following reports / profiles with a view to thinking about employability and how the skills acquired in this module can be applied beyond the end of your MSc:

## Practical

The practical will lead you through the application of grouping and aggregation functions in pandas, and the fine-tuning of data visualisations in Matplotlib/Seaborn. In many ways, this should be seen (bar the aggregation) as largely a recap of material encountered in previous sessions. However, you should see this as a critical step in the production of outputs and analyses needed for the final project.

## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Linking data as part of a visualisation process.
- Automating the production of map outputs in Python to create an 'atlas'.
- Thinking about proxies; e.g. why would you find ppsqm more/less useful than price? what are you *really* measuring?
