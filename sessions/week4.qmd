title: "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle"
week: 4

## Overview

This week we will look at how frequently-used code can be packaged up in functions and libraries. This is the point at which we begin to engage with code in a more abstract way because we are increasingly interested in reusability and flexibility.

::: {.callout-important}

### Learning Objectives

1. To develop an understanding of code re-use through functions.
2. To develop an appreciation of the utility of packages and namespaces.

::: 

This week we also start to move beyond Code Camp, so although you should recognise many of the _parts_ that we discuss,  you'll see that we begin to put them together in a new way. The next two weeks are a critical transition between content that you might have seen before in Code Camp (see [Practical](#practical)) or other introductory materials, and the 'data science' approach.

### Readings

You will find @Unwin:1980 useful for understanding why the practicals are set up the way they are and why we don't post 'answers' until a few days after the last practical group has completed its session. @Donoho:2017 will give you context on how data science might differ from what's covered in Quantitative Methods, and @Etherington:2016 will hopefully help you to see how spatial and programming concepts can be connected to one another to improve our understanding of *both*. For a particularly good example of this see the *GIS Algorithms* text [@xiao:2016].

## Practical

This week's practical will be looking at how functions (and variables) can be collected into resuable packages that we can either make ourselves or draw on a worldwide bank of experts -- I know who _I'd_ rather depend on when the opportunity arises! However, if you have *not yet completed Code Camp* (or were not aware of it!), then you will benefit *enormously* from tackling the following sessions:

- [Functions](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/lessons/Functions.html)
- [Packages](https://jreades.github.io/code-camp/lessons/Functions.html)

### Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Seeing how functions and decorators can help us to reuse code efficiently.
- Beginning to make use of packages to access/interact with data.

::: 

To access the practical:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
#| code-fold: false

prac = "Practical-04-Reuse"

print("1. [Preview]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".html)")
print("2. [Download]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".ipynb)")

```
