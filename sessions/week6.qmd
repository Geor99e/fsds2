title: "Spatial Data"
---

## Overview

This week we will be focussing on the use of the geopandas library for spatial data analysis and management through a focus on spatial data and its distribution(s). Geopandas will help to clarify how Object-Oriented design and inheritance processes work, while also allowing to interrogate and map the assigned data set(s). A critical concept that should be emerging here is that spatial and numerical data analyses are, fundamentally, just two different views of the same data.

## Learning Outcomes

1. You develop better *judgement* about interpreting and representing data.
2. You understand how GeoPandas *extends* Pandas with spatial functionality.
3. You build on material covered in Week 1-3, and 5 of CASA0005 to extend your understanding of mapping and spatial data.
4. You develop better *practices* for (spatial) data exploration.
::: 

So we're going to be looking at both how to work geo-data in Python *and* how to explore a real-world data set using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Exploratory *Spatial* Data Analysis (ESDA) approaches to mapping distributions, testing for NaNs, and so on.

## Connections

The really crucial insight here is to see how we are constantly looking back to *earlier* concepts, data structures, and tools to assemble our data and data visualisations in a *computational* manner: caching local data, defining the corners of a map, zooming in/out, creating coordinate pairs from a tuple, etc. The *hard* part is that Python's most-used way of presenting data visually (`matplotlib`) works utterly differently from `ggplot`: `matplotlib` is much more like a canvas on to which things are 'painted' by the computer and much less like a series of data transformations using a 'grammer of graphics'. On the whole, `ggplot` is easier to learn and, often, can yield better-looking plots, whereas `matplotlib` is a bit like dropping through the looking glass into a world where *everything* can be changed and tweaked endlessly but it's hard to get something that looks good without a *lot* more work.

## Practical

In the practical we will continue to work with the InsideAirbnb data, here focussing on the second 'class' of data in the data set: geography. We will see how to use GoePandas and PySAL for (geo)visualisation and analysis.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Creating/working with geo-data in Python.
- Making maps with Python.
- Exploring the data visually.

To access the practical:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
#| code-fold: false

prac = "Practical-06-Spatial_Data"

print("1. [Preview]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".html)")
print("2. [Download]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".ipynb)")
