title: "Reading Week"

## Overview

Past student performance *strongly* suggests that you should engage with the assigned readings in order to do well on the [Data Audit](../assessments/audit.qmd).

::: {.callout-important}
This week's learning objectives are:

1. Get caught up on any missed reading(s).
2. Start to think about the research question(s) for your *Policy Briefing*.
3. Start to think about how you *might* ask your question(s) of the data.
:::

Looking ahead to the [Group Work](../assessments/group.qmd), I'd *also* strongly suggest that you browse the [Full Reference List](../references.qmd) for ideas. The bibliography is a working document and I will add more items as and when I come across them or new works are published, but this is a good time to start reading about the ethical and practical issues arising from Airbnb's operations and the data to which we have access.

## Readings

For the group work you will also want to consider:

## Additional Context

You might also find the following content interesting in terms of the practical limitations of 'AI' tools and the ways in which they reproduce errors in our own thinking rather that offering a neutral insight into processes:

- [Mission Control: A History of the Urban Dashboard](https://placesjournal.org/article/mission-control-a-history-of-the-urban-dashboard/)
- [AI translation jeopardises Afghan asylum claims](https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-translation-errors-afghan-refugees-asylum/)
- [An Iowa school district is using ChatGPT to decide which books to ban](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/an-iowa-school-district-is-using-chatgpt-to-decide-which-books-to-ban/)
- [Singapore's tech-utopia dream is turning into a surveillance state nightmare](https://restofworld.org/2021/singapores-tech-utopia-dream-is-turning-into-a-surveillance-state-nightmare/)

And here's a nice example of why it's *not* about the algorithm:
