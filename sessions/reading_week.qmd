title: "Reading Week"

## Overview

::: {.callout-important}
This week's learning objectives are:

1. Get caught up on any missed reading(s).
2. Start to work on the first few questions of the [group assessment](../assessments/group.qmd).
3. Start to test your ability to work with the Inside Airbnb data ([Week 5 Practical](week5.qmd#practical)).
:::

Past student performance *strongly* suggests that this is a good week to:

1. Catch up on readings, particularly the more *critical* ones and the ones focussing on the impact of Airbnb.
2. Go back over the first five notebooks in order to self-test and check your understanding. This doesn't mean re-doing the full notebook, but (for example) seeing if you can use `pandas` to analyse the simpler data we looked at in weeks 3 and 4.

Looking ahead to the [Group Work](../assessments/group.qmd), I'd *also* strongly suggest that you browse the [Full Reference List](../references.qmd) for ideas. The bibliography is a working document and I will add more items as and when I come across them or new works are published, but this is a good time to start reading about the ethical and practical issues arising from Airbnb's operations and the data to which we have access.

## Readings

The following articles will be discussed in-class over the coming weeks:

- @Amoore:2019 <[URL](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0263276419851846)>
- @mattern:2020 <[URL](https://doi.org/10.22269/170207)>
- @mattern:2015 <[URL](https://doi.org/10.22269/150309)>

For the group work you might also want to at least *consider* the following articles and outputs:

- @Elwood:2018 <[URL](https://doi.org/10.1080/0966369X.2018.1465396)>
- @Bemt:2018 <[URL](https://doi.org/10.1080/03098265.2018.1436534)>
- @Crawford:2015 <[URL](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-014-9597-z)>

## Connections

I am *not* suggesting that you read every one of these readings (though split across a group this is light work!); rather, I am pointing you towards content that can inform your responses to the set questions in the [Group Work](../assessments/group.qmd). These readings focus on the *ethical* issues raised by spatial data science and algorithmic approaches to decision-making. You should be drawing connections to @dignazio:2020 and their data-informed critiques of 'just let the data scientists crunch the data' thinking. Some of these readings may feel *very* challenging in terms of their language or approach to Machine Learning/AI, but they will reward attention and reflection, and you can expect to see this reflected in a better mark on the group project as your engagement with the substance of the assesmsnet will also be more reflective and relevant.

## Additional Context

You might also find the following content interesting in terms of the practical limitations of 'AI' tools and the ways in which they reproduce errors in our own thinking rather that offering a neutral insight into processes:

- [AI translation jeopardises Afghan asylum claims](https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-translation-errors-afghan-refugees-asylum/)
- [An Iowa school district is using ChatGPT to decide which books to ban](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/an-iowa-school-district-is-using-chatgpt-to-decide-which-books-to-ban/)
- [Singapore's tech-utopia dream is turning into a surveillance state nightmare](https://restofworld.org/2021/singapores-tech-utopia-dream-is-turning-into-a-surveillance-state-nightmare/)

And here's a nice example of why it's *not* about the algorithm:
