title: "Selecting Data"
---

## Overview


::: {.callout-important}
## Learning Outcomes

1. You have formalised your understanding of how to link data in Python.
3. You are working intensively on the [group project](../assessments/group.qmd).

::: 

## Lectures

You are *strongly* advised to watch these videos on linking data and spatial data, as well how to group data within pandas; *however*, you will not be asked to present any of these because our attention is now on the final assessments. As well, you should by now be familiar with the concept of how to join data from the GIS module ([CASA0005](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/)), so this focusses on two things: 1) how to *do* this in Python; and 2) how to approach this process with large or mismatched data sets.

| Session | Video | Presentation | 
| :------ | :---- | :----------- | 
| Linking Data | [Video]({{< var vids.linking >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/10.1-Linking_Data.qmd) | 
| Linking Spatial Data | [Video]({{< var vids.linkingsp >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/10.2-Linking_Spatial_Data.qmd) | 

## Other Prep

- Come to class prepared to briefly present/discuss:

- Complete the [short Moodle quiz]({{< var quiz.week9 >}}) associated with this week's activities.

You may also want to look at the following reports / profiles with a view to thinking about employability and how the skills acquired in this module can be applied beyond the end of your MSc:

- Geospatial Skills Report <[URL](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/demand-for-geospatial-skills-report-for-the-geospatial-commission)>
- AAG Profile of Nicolas Saravia <[URL](https://www.aag.org/profile/nicolas-saravia/)>
- @wolf:2021 <[URL](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0309132520924722)>

## Connections

While I expect most of you will be focussed on assessments, you should *seriously* consider returning to these readings over the term break as they will help you to *reflect* on what you've learned this term -- in this module and across the programme as a whole -- in terms of the direction of the field, the opportunities in industry, and the kinds of work that people with (sptial) data science skills can do.

## Practical

The practical will lead you through the application of grouping and aggregation functions in pandas, and the fine-tuning of data visualisations in Matplotlib/Seaborn. In many ways, this should be seen (bar the aggregation) as largely a recap of material encountered in previous sessions. However, you should see this as an important step in the production of outputs and analyses needed for the final project. That said, you would be better off spending time on the *substance* of the report first and only turning to the fine-tuning of the visualisations if time permits.

## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Linking data as part of a visualisation process.
- Automating the production of map outputs in Python to create an 'atlas'.
- Thinking about proxies; e.g. why would you find ppsqm more/less useful than price? what are you *really* measuring?
