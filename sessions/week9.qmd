title: "Selecting Data"
week: 9
---

## Overview



::: {.callout-important}
## Learning Outcomes

1. You have formalised your understanding of how to link data in Python.
2. You are working on the [group project](../assessments/group.qmd).

::: 

## Preparatory Lectures

You are *strongly* advised to watch these videos on linking data and spatial data, as well how to group data within pandas; *however*, you will not be asked to present any of these because our attention is now on the final assessments. As well, you should by now be familiar with the concept of how to join data from the GIS module ([CASA0005](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/)), so this focusses on two things: 1) how to *do* this in Python (with a bit of SQL thrown in); and 2) how to approach this process with large or mismatched data sets.

| Session | Video | Presentation | 
| :------ | :---- | :----------- | 
| Linking Data | [Video]({{< var vids.linking >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/{{< meta week >}}.1-Linking_Data.qmd) | 
| Linking Spatial Data | [Video]({{< var vids.linkingsp >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/{{< meta week >}}.2-Linking_Spatial_Data.qmd) |

## Practical

The practical will lead you through the selection of data in pandas and the equivalent using SQL via DuckDB.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Connections

The practical focusses on:

- Comparing different approaches to data linkage
- Linking data as part of a visualisation process.

:::

To access the practical:

```{python}
#| output: asis
#| echo: false
#| code-fold: false

prac = "Practical-09-Selecting_Data"

print("1. [Preview]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".html)")
print("2. [Download]({{< var module.web >}}practicals/" + prac + ".ipynb)")

```
