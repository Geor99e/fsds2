title: "Timed Open Book Exam"
---

This 'exam' (due {{< var assess.quiz-date >}} and worth {{< var assess.quiz-weight >}}) will be administered as a quiz through Moodle: you will be asked to download a small data set and perform a series of specified analytical tasks using that data. For each question you will be asked *both* to type in an answer (which may be numerical or textual) and to paste in the code that you have used to obtain that answer. 

## Expectations

This is the first year that we have attempted to run a timed, open-book examination as part of this module so we may make adjustments to the process based on the capabilities of the class (taken in the round) and the challenges presented by the data set selected. 

However, as a general set of expectations:

- Any content covered prior to Week 7 may be encountered in the exam (so we will *not* test you on material covered in, or after, the [Textual Data](../sessions/week7.qmd) session.
- The *principal* library upon which the exam will rely is [pandas](), though we may also make *limited* use of [geopandas]() in the final questions.
- The exam is 'open book', but there are *two* important limitations: 
  1. You may not obtain direct assisstance from another person (either in-person or online); 
  2. You may not *ask* questions relating to the exam on StackOverflow or other 'online help boards'. 
  3. By implication, you *can* use ChatGPT or other LLMs. 
- If you make use of an external resource (e.g. find relevant code on StackOverflow or use ChatGPT) you should include a citation in the code submission area of the form: `# Source: <link to resource used>`.
- Anyone found to have cheated on this submission will receive a mark of `0` and the resit assessment will involve producing an analysis in a timed context under direct supervision of module staff: in other words, you will be required to be present *in-person* for the resit (this is likely to be during the summer period) and will have 3 hours in which to complete a set of coding tasks specified by the module leader.

In other words: don't do it.
