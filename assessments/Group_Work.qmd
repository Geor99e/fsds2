# Response to Questions

```{python}
import os
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
host = 'https://orca.casa.ucl.ac.uk'
path = '~jreades/data'
file = '2022-09-10-listings.csv.gz'
url  = f'{host}/{path}/{file}'

if os.path.exists(file):
  df = pd.read_csv(file, compression='gzip', low_memory=False)
else: 
  df = pd.read_csv(url, compression='gzip', low_memory=False)

```

```{python}
ax = df.host_listings_count.plot.hist(bins=50);
ax.set_xlim([0,500]);
```
