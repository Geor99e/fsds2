title: "Individual Reflection (20%)"
---

This individual assessment due {{< var assess.individual >}} asks you to reflect *on the process* of 'doing data science' as part of a team, since this format is typical of real-world projects. Many companies (e.g. Apple, Google, etc.) employ an Agile project format in which teams undertake a 'Retrospective' at the end of a project in order to identify ways to improve how they work in the future. We are *not* asking you to do this as a group (indeed, it's an *individual* reflection), but we hope that this will help you to develop as a budding analyst or data scientist.

## Format

You must answer these 3 questions:

1. What factors do you think help to explain what went well/not well in the project? *3 points; 200 words; Critically engaging with challenges faced by the group will **not** result in a low mark.*
2. How do you think the other students in *your* group would evaluate *your* contribution to each of these outcomes? *12 points; 400 words; Honesty is the best policy here as we may compare your response with that of the rest of the group.*
3. Briefly describe *one* event or experience from the group assessment that gave you new insight into 'doing' data science, and explain how and why this will be useful to you in the future. *10 points; 400 words; Try to connect this to either/both of employability and transferrable skills.*

A [marking rubric](./Individual_Reflection_Rubric.pdf) is available.

## Restrictions

The word limit for this assessment is **1,000 words**. The per-question word counts above are indicative and are not a 'hard' limit. 

Do not use tables or figures.

Any works referenced should appear in a *Bibliography*.
