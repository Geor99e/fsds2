title: "Written Content"
---

The *Content* is worth {{< var assess.group-writing-weight >}} of the [Group Assessment](./group.qmd). You will be writing **for a non-technical audience**: imagine that you are writing an outline proposal to undertake a piece of research for the Mayor of London.

Consequently, through set questions the *Content* will establish the suitability of data taken from the [Inside Airbnb web site for London](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) ifor policy-making and, specifically, for the regulation of Short-Term Lets (STL) in London.

The responses to the set questions *may* be written *without* substantially new modelling or coding through the judicious use of descriptive statistics (see, for instance, [Housing and Inequality in London](https://www.centreforlondon.org/publication/housing-and-inequality-in-london/) and [The suburbanisation of poverty in British cities, 2004-16: extent, processes and nature](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2017.1405689)), but it is likely that a *better* mark will be obtained by demonstrating the capacity to go beyond exactly what was taught in class. 

Students may use data from more than one time period if they wish, but this is not required. 

## Format

This is _not_ an essay, and students who submit a traditional essay format will see their overall mark impacted as a result. You must preserve the question/response format, and your responses should stress intelligibility to an intelligent, but non-technical audience. This doesn't mean that you don't need citations, but you should not employ academic writing styles.

Examples of the kind of tone and presentation format expected in response to the set questions are provided below and there will be opportunities to discuss the submission during Term. You should refer to the [models](./models.qmd) provided for insight into how to write for the target audience.

## Write for Your Audience

What makes writing a good briefing *hard*---and not just about writing good code---is finding the right balance of technical detail and high-level explanation: you can't just say 'here are the five types of accommodation we found...', but you *also* can't say 'we tested clustering solutions in the range 3--50 and found the optimal result at `k=12`...' You should have a look at the [examples](./models.qmd).
