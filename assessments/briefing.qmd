title: "Policy Briefing"
---

The *Policy Briefing* is worth 60% of the [Group Assessment](./group.qmd), meaning that it is worth 30% of your overall mark.

The *Policy Briefing* will present an analysis of data from the [Inside Airbnb web site for London](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). Students may use data from more than one time period if they wish, but this is not required. The briefing will be written ***as if* to update** the Mayor of the Greater London Authority on the challenges/opportunities relating to Airbnb's operations in London. As such, the *Policy Briefing* will begin with a short Summary, including *Key Findings* and, if desired, *Recommendations*; this will typically be followed by a brief **review of the evidence** from London (and potentially elsewhere, if relevant) and an analysis supported by the data. Your analysis will be supported using appropriately selected and generated **tables**, **charts**, and **maps**.

The briefing *may* be written *without* substantially new modelling or coding by drawing on the code written in practicals to develop an analysis based on the judicious use of descriptive statistics (see, for instance, [Housing and Inequality in London](https://www.centreforlondon.org/publication/housing-and-inequality-in-london/) and [The suburbanisation of poverty in British cities, 2004-16: extent, processes and nature](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2017.1405689)), but it is likely that a *better* mark will be obtained by demonstrating the capacity to go beyond exactly what was taught by selectively deploying more advanced programming techniques. 

## Format

This is _not_ an essay, and students who submit a traditional essay format will see their overall mark impacted as a result. Examples of the kind of format, tone, and content expected are provided below and there will be opportunities to discuss the submission during Term. You should refer to the [models](./models.qmd) provided for insight into how to organise the briefing and how to write for a target audience.

## Write for Your Audience

Always remember that you are writing this briefing *for the Mayor of London*! Are they going to know what *k*-Means Clustering is? Will they *care*? 

What makes writing a good briefing *hard*---and not just about writing good code---is finding the right balance of technical detail and high-level explanation: you can't just say 'here are the five types of accommodation we found...', but you *also* can't say 'we tested clustering solutions in the range 3--50 and found the optimal result at `k=12`...' You should have a look at the [examples](./models.qmd).

## Preparing Your Submission

You are expected to use sustainable authorship tools for this submission. You may be asked to provide evidence of this. You are free use the [Data Audit Template](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/assessments/Data_Audit.qmd) as a starting point if you wish, but should probably look at the [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) and, in particular, the [PDF options](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html) in order to customise your project. Full LaTeX is also an option.

You must develop and maintain the submission in GitHub so that we can review contributions if necessary.
