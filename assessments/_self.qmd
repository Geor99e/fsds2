You must answer these 3 questions for formative purposes as part of the submission process and prior to submitting the peer marks:

1. What factors do you think help to explain what went well/not well in the project? 
2. How do you think the other students in *your* group would evaluate *your* contribution to each of these outcomes? 
3. Briefly describe *one* event or experience from the group assessment that gave you new insight into 'doing' data science, and explain how and why this will be useful to you in the future.
