Geopandas will help to clarify how Object-Oriented design and inheritance processes work, while also allowing to interrogate and map the assigned data set(s). A critical concept that should be emerging here is that spatial and numerical data analyses are, fundamentally, just two different views of the same data. \n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Learning Outcomes\n\n1. You develop better *judgement* about interpreting and representing data.\n2. You understand how GeoPandas *extends* Pandas with spatial functionality.\n3. You build on material covered in Week 1-3, and 5 of CASA0005 to extend your understanding of mapping and spatial data.\n4. You develop better *practices* for (spatial) data exploration.\n::: \n\nSo we're going to be looking at both how to work geo-data in Python *and* how to explore a real-world data set using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Exploratory *Spatial* Data Analysis (ESDA) approaches to mapping distributions, testing for NaNs, and so on.\n\n## Lectures\n\nCome to class prepared to present/discuss:\n\n| Session | Video | Presentation | \n| :------ | :---- | :----------- | \n| Mapping | [Video]({{< var vids.mapping >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/6.1-Mapping.qmd) | \n| GeoPandas | [Video]({{< var vids.geopandas >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/6.2-Geopandas.qmd) | \n| EDA | [Video]({{< var vids.eda >}}) |[Slides](../lectures/6.3-EDA.qmd) | \n| ESDA | [Video]({{< var vids.esda >}}) | [Slides](../lectures/6.4-ESDA.qmd) | \n\n## Other Prep\n\n- Come to class prepared to present:\n  - @dignazio:2020, chap. 6, *The Numbers Don't Speak for Themselves* <[URL](https://ucl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9931206723604761&context=L&vid=44UCL_INST:UCL_VU2&lang=en&search_scope=UCLLibraryCatalogue&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=UCLLibraryCatalogue&query=any,contains,D%5C%27Ignazio%20Data%20Feminism&sortby=date_d&facet=frbrgroupid,include,9041340239229546206&offset=0)> \n  - @Elwood:2017 <[URL](https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2017.1334892)>\n- Complete the [short Moodle quiz]({{< var quiz.week6 >}}) associated with this week's activities.\n- Student Dialogue: [Mentimeter poll](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=4389751&forceview=1) to be completed by the start of class.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Connections\n\nThe really crucial insight here is to see how we are constantly looking back to *earlier* concepts, data structures, and tools to assemble our data and data visualisations in a *computational* manner: caching local data, defining the corners of a map, zooming in/out, creating coordinate pairs from a tuple, etc. The *hard* part is that Python's most-used way of presenting data visually (`matplotlib`) works utterly differently from `ggplot`: `matplotlib` is much more like a canvas on to which things are 'painted' by the computer and much less like a series of data transformations using a 'grammer of graphics'. On the whole, `ggplot` is easier to learn and, often, can yield better-looking plots, whereas `matplotlib` is a bit like dropping through the looking glass into a world where *everything* can be changed and tweaked endlessly but it's hard to get something that looks good without a *lot* more work.\n\n:::\n\n## Practical\n\nIn the practical we will continue to work with the InsideAirbnb data, here focussing on the second 'class' of data in the data set: geography. We will see how to use GoePandas and PySAL for (geo)visualisation and analysis.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Connections\n\nThe practical focusses on:\n\n- Creating/working with geo-data in Python.\n- Making maps with Python.\n- Exploring the data visually.\n:::\n\nTo access the practical:\n\n1.
