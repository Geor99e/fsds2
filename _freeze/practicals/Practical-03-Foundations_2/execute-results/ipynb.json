To achieve that, you will need to be 'fluent' in \"nested\" lists and dictionaries; we will focus primarily on lists-of-lists and dictionaries-of-lists, but note that file formats like JSON can be understood as dictionaries-of-dictionaries-of-lists-of-... so this is just a *taster* of real-world data structures.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nYou should download this notebook from GitHub and then save it to your own copy of the repository. I'd suggest adding it (`git add ...`) right away and then committing (e.g. `git commit -m \"Just added.\"`). Do this again at the end of the class (`git add ...`, `git commit -m ...`) and you'll have a record of everything you did. Then you can `git push` everything to GitHub.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n#### Group Sign-Up\n\nWhile there's no benefit to signing up early, if you've already formed a group then you can now [Sign Up](https://forms.office.com/e/2ij0sWHnpR)!\n\n:::\n\n# From Lists to Data (Little Steps)\n\nWe're going to start off using lists and dictionaries that _we_ define right at the start of the 'program', but the _real_ value of these data structures comes when we build a list or dictionary _from_ data such as a file or a web page... and that's what we're going to do below!\n\n\nFirst, here's a reminder of some useful methods (_i.e._ functions) that apply to lists which we covered in the [lecture](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week2.html#lectures) and [practical](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week2.html#practical) in Week 2:\n\n| Method                 | Action |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `list.count(x)`        | Return the number of times x appears in the list                 |\n| `list.insert(i, x)`    | Insert value `x` at a given position `i`                         |\n| `list.pop([i])`        | Remove and return the value at position `i` (`i` is optional)    |\n| `list.remove(x)`       | Remove the first element from the list whose value is `x`        |\n| `list.reverse()`       | Reverse the elements of the list in place                        |\n| `list.sort()`          | Sort the items of the list in place                              |\n| `list.index(x)`        | Find the first occurence of `x` in the list                      |\n| `list[x:y]`            | Slice the list from index `x` to `y-1`                           |\n\nThis should all be revision... because it's how we finished things up _last week_.

A key difference between [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) and [lists](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) is that while elements in lists are ordered, dicts (in most programming languages, though not Python) are unordered. This means that whereas for lists we use integers as indexes to access elements, in dictonaries we use 'keys' (which can multiple different types; strings, integers, etc.). Consequently, an important concept for dicts is that of key-value pairs. \n\n## Creating an Atlas\n\nThe code below creates an Atlas using a dictionary. The dictionary `key` is a city name, and the `value` is the latitude, longitude, and main airport code.\n\n::: {#88e4cee8 .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncities = {\n    'San Francisco': [37.77, -122.43, 'SFO'],\n    'London': [51.51, -0.08, 'LDN'],\n    'Paris': [48.86,2.29, 'PAR'],\n    'Beijing': [39.92,116.40 ,'BEI'],\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Adding to a Dict \n\nAdd a record to the dictionary for Chennai ([data here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai))\n\n:::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\n```python\n??\n```\n\n#### Answer\n\n::: {#3e55534f .cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncities['Chennai'] = [13.08, 80.28, 'MAA']\n```\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\n### Accessing a Dict \n\nIn *one* line of code, print out the airport code for Chennai (`MAA`):\n\n:::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\n```python\n??\n```\n\n#### Answer\n\n::: {#13931601 .cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(f\"The airport code for Chennai is {cities['Chennai'][2]}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe airport code for Chennai is MAA\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\n## Dealing With Errors\n\nCheck you understand the difference between the following two blocks of code by running them.\n\n::: {#df716842 .cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntry:\n    print(cities['Berlin'])\nexcept KeyError as e:\n    print(\"Error found\")\n    print(e)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nError found\n'Berlin'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#be77574b .cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntry:\n    print(cities.get('Berlin','Not Found'))\nexcept KeyError as e:\n    print(\"Error found\")\n    print(e)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nNot Found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that trying to access a non-existent element of a dict triggers a `KeyError`, while asking the dict to `get` the _same element_ does not, it simply returns `None`.

This sounds hard. It _is_ hard when you're just starting out in programming. But it is _not_ hard for a computer... _iff_ we can figure out what to tell it to do _and_ make use of work that other people have done for us!\n\n### What Do We Do? Break It Down!\n\n#### Step 1. Analyse the Problem\n\nThe first step to writing a program is thinking about your goal and the steps required to achieve that. We _**don't**_ write programs like we write essays: all at once by writing a whole lot of code and then hoping for the best when we hit 'submit'. \n\nWhen you're tackling a programming problem you break it down into separate, simpler steps, and then tick them off one by one. Doing this gets easier as you become more familiar with programming, but it remains crucial and, in many cases, good programmers in large companies spend more time on _design_ than they do on actual _coding_.\n\n#### Step 2. Functions & Packages\n\nWe have discussed how _functions_ are a useful programming tool to enable us to re-use chunks of code. Basically, a function is a way to do something to something in a portable, easy-to-use little bundle of code. \n\nSome steps in a program are done so many times by so many people that, eventually, someone writes a _package_ that bundles up those operations into something easy to use that saves _you_ having to figure out the gory details. Reading a file (even one on a computer halfway round the world) is one of those things. Making sense of the data *in* that file for you is probably not.\n\n![xkcd: Easy vs. Hard](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tasks.png)\n\nTo a computer, reading data from a remote location (e.g. a web site halfway around the world) is not really any different from reading one that's sitting on your your local hard drive (e.g. on your desktop). To simplify things a great deal: the computer really just needs to know the location of the file and an appropriate _protocol_ for accessing that file (_e.g._ http, https, ftp, local...) and then a clever programming language like Python will typically have packages that can kind of take of the rest. \n\nIn all cases -- local and remote -- you use the package to handle the hard bit of knowing how to actually 'read' data (because all files are just `1`s and `0`s of data) at the _device_ level and then Python gives you back a 'file handle' that helps you to achieve things like 'read a line' or 'close an open file'. You can think of a filehandle as something that gives you a 'grip' on a file-like object no matter where or what it is, and the package is the way that this magic is achieved.\n\n#### Step 3. Look for Ways to Recycle\n\n**Always** look for ways to avoid reinventing the wheel. This is where Python's packages (or R's for that matter) come into their own. If it's something that programmers often need to do, then chances are that someone has written a package to do it!\n\nThe point of packages is that they can help us to achieve quite a lot very quickly since we can just make use of someone else's code. In the same way that we won't mark you down for Googling the answer to a coding question, we _also_ won't mark you down for using someone else's package to help you get going with your programming. _**That's the whole point!**_\n\nOften, if you're not sure where to start, Google (or StackOverflow) is the place to go:\n\n[`how to read text file on web server python`](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=how+to+read+text+file+on+web+server+python&oq=how+to+read+text+file+on+web+server+python&aqs=chrome..69i57.629j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)\n\nBoom!\n\n#### Step 4. Make a Plan\n\nOK, so we need to break this _hard_ problem down into something simpler. We can do this by thinking about it as three separate steps:\n\n1. We want to read a remote file (i.e. a text file somewhere the planet), \n2. We want to turn it into a local data structure (i.e a list or a dictionary), \n3. We want to perform some calculations on the data (e.g. calculate the mean, find the easternmost city, etc.).\n\nWe can tackle each of those in turn, getting the first bit working, then adding the second bit, etc. It's just like using lego to build something: you take the same pieces and assemble them in different ways to produce different things.\n\n## Reading a Remote File\n\nSo, we are going to [download a file from GitHub](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/data/src/Wikipedia-Cities-simple.csv), but we **aren't going to to try to turn it into data** or otherwise make 'sense' of it yet, we just want to **read** it. We are then going to build from this first step towards the rest of the steps!\n\nBecause we're accessing data from a 'URL' we need to use the `urlopen` [function](https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/urllib.request.html?highlight=urlopen#urllib.request.urlopen) from the `urllib.request` [package](https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/urllib.request.html). If you're wondering how we know to use this function and package, you might google something like: _read remote csv file python 3_ which in turn might get you to a StackOverflow question and answer like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36965864/opening-a-url-with-urllib-in-python-3). \n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.longform {\n    max-height: 500px;\n    overflow-y: scroll;\n}\n</style>\n\n::: {.longform}\n\n::: {#2869b7d6 .cell execution_count=25}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\nhelp(urlopen)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nHelp on function urlopen in module urllib.request:\n\nurlopen(url, data=None, timeout=<object object at 0x10151cb70>, *, cafile=None, capath=None, cadefault=False, context=None)\n    Open the URL url, which can be either a string or a Request object.\n\n    *data* must be an object specifying additional data to be sent to\n    the server, or None if no such data is needed.  See Request for\n    details.\n\n    urllib.request module uses HTTP/1.1 and includes a \"Connection:close\"\n    header in its HTTP requests.\n\n    The optional *timeout* parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for\n    blocking operations like the connection attempt (if not specified, the\n    global default timeout setting will be used). This only works for HTTP,\n    HTTPS and FTP connections.\n\n    If *context* is specified, it must be a ssl.SSLContext instance describing\n    the various SSL options. See HTTPSConnection for more details.\n\n    The optional *cafile* and *capath* parameters specify a set of trusted CA\n    certificates for HTTPS requests. cafile should point to a single file\n    containing a bundle of CA certificates, whereas capath should point to a\n    directory of hashed certificate files. More information can be found in\n    ssl.SSLContext.load_verify_locations().\n\n    The *cadefault* parameter is ignored.\n\n\n    This function always returns an object which can work as a\n    context manager and has the properties url, headers, and status.\n    See urllib.response.addinfourl for more detail on these properties.\n\n    For HTTP and HTTPS URLs, this function returns a http.client.HTTPResponse\n    object slightly modified. In addition to the three new methods above, the\n    msg attribute contains the same information as the reason attribute ---\n    the reason phrase returned by the server --- instead of the response\n    headers as it is specified in the documentation for HTTPResponse.\n\n    For FTP, file, and data URLs and requests explicitly handled by legacy\n    URLopener and FancyURLopener classes, this function returns a\n    urllib.response.addinfourl object.\n\n    Note that None may be returned if no handler handles the request (though\n    the default installed global OpenerDirector uses UnknownHandler to ensure\n    this never happens).\n\n    In addition, if proxy settings are detected (for example, when a *_proxy\n    environment variable like http_proxy is set), ProxyHandler is default\n    installed and makes sure the requests are handled through the proxy.\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nAs you can see, there is _lot_ of information here about how things work.

This is a '[proxy error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7334199/getaddrinfo-failed-what-does-that-mean)' and in this case you may need to [configure your environment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28153935) as follows:\n\n```\nimport os\nos.environ['HTTP_PROXY'] = 'http://127.0.0.1:10809'\nos.environ['HTTPS_PROXY'] = 'http://127.0.0.1:10809'\n```\n\n:::\n\nBefore you start working on the code, why not open the data file [directly in your browser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jreades/fsds/master/data/src/Wikipedia-Cities-simple.csv)? It's pretty small, and it will give you a sense of what is going on.\n\n\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.request import URLError\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\n\n# Given the info you were given above, what do you \n# think the value of 'url' should be?

The 'raw' data is in _bytecode_ format which is not, strictly, a `string`. It only becomes a string when we 'decode it' to `utf-8` (which is the 'encoding' of text that supports most human languages). While the computer doesn't particularly care, we do!\n\n:::\n\nRemember that you can treat strings *as lists*, so when we `print` below we cut off the output using the `list[:<Some Number>]` syntax.\n\n::: {#fd33e622 .cell execution_count=27}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(f\"There are {len(data)} characters in the data variable.\")\nprint(f\"The first 125 characters are: '{data[:125]}'\") # Notice that '\\n' count here!\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThere are 352 characters in the data variable.\nThe first 125 characters are: 'City,Population,Latitude,Longitude\r\nPerth,45770,56.39583,-3.43333\r\nArmagh,14777,54.3499,-6.6546\r\nDundee,147268,56.462,-2.9707'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo this is definitely text, but it doesn't (yet) look entirely like the data *we* see because it's still just one long string, and not *data* which has individual records on each line.

You've also converted a plain-text file to a row-formatted list.\n\n## Text into Data\n\nWe now need to work on turning the response into useful data. We got partway there by splitting on line-breaks (`splitlines()`), but now we need to get columns for each line. You'll notice that we are dealing with a _CSV_ (Comma-Separated Value) file and that the format _looks_ quite simple... So, in theory, to turn this into data we 'just' need to _split_ each row into separate fields using the commas.\n\nThere's a handy function associated with strings called `split`:\n\n::: {#7d06b001 .cell execution_count=31}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint('abcdefgh'.split('d'))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n['abc', 'efgh']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can also investigate further how the split function works using:\n\n::: {#109524cd .cell execution_count=32}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nhelp('abcdefgh'.split)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nHelp on built-in function split:\n\nsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1) method of builtins.str instance\n    Return a list of the substrings in the string, using sep as the separator string.\n\n      sep\n        The separator used to split the string.\n\n        When set to None (the default value), will split on any whitespace\n        character (including \\n \\r \\t \\f and spaces) and will discard\n        empty strings from the result.\n      maxsplit\n        Maximum number of splits.\n        -1 (the default value) means no limit.\n\n    Splitting starts at the front of the string and works to the end.\n\n    Note, str.split() is mainly useful for data that has been intentionally\n    delimited.  With natural text that includes punctuation, consider using\n    the regular expression module.\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo this seems like a good solution to turn our text into *data*:\n\n::: {#176d9d99 .cell execution_count=33}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntest = rows[-1].split(',')\nprint(test)\nprint(f\"The population of {test[0]} is {int(test[1]):,}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n['Bangor', '18808', '53.228', '-4.128']\nThe population of Bangor is 18,808\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI'd say that we're now getting quite close to something that looks like 'real data': I know how to convert a raw response from a web server into a string, to split that string into rows, and can even access individual elements from a row! \n\n## The Advantages of a Package\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n\nThere are two problems to the `data.splitlines()` and `row.split(',')` approach! One of them is visible (though not obvious) in the examples above, the other is not.\n\n:::\n\n1. Remember that `10` and `'10'` are _not_ the same thing. To comma-format the population of Sheffield you'll see that I had to do `int(...)` in order to turn `'685368'` into a number. So our approach so far doesn't know anything about the _type_ of data we're working with.\n2. We are also implicitly _assuming_ that commas can only appear at field boundaries (i.e. that they can only appear to separate one column of data from the next). In other words, just using `split(',')` doesn't work if *any* of the fields can themselves contain a comma!\n3. There's actually a _third_ potential issue, but it's so rare that we would need to take a completely different approach to deal with it: we are also assuming that newlines (`\\n`) can only appear at record boundaries (i.e. that the can only appear to separate one row of data from the next). In those cases, using `splitlines()` also doesn't work, but this situation is (thankfully) very rare indeed.\n\nThis is where using code that someone _else_ who is much more interested (and knowledgeable) has written and contributed is helpful: we don't need to think through how to deal with this sort of thing ourselves, we can just find a library that does what we need and make use of _its_ functionality. I've given you the skeleton of the answer below, but you'll need to do a little Googling to find out how to `\"read csv python\"`. \n\n**Note:** For now just focus on problem \\#2.\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\nimport csv\n\nurl = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jreades/fsds/master/data/src/Wikipedia-Cities-simple.csv'\nresponse = urlopen(url)\nraw = response.read()\n\n# Now take the raw data, decode it, and then\n# pass it over to the CSV reader function\ncsvfile  = csv.reader(raw.decode('utf-8').splitlines()) \n\nurlData = [] # Somewhere to store the data\nfor row in csvfile:              \n    urlData.append( row )\n\nprint(\"urlData has \" + str(len(urlData)) + \" rows and \" + str(len(urlData[0])) + \" columns.\")\nprint(urlData[-1]) # Check it worked!\n```\n\n\n\nIf it worked, then you should have this output:\n\n::: {#2279e372 .cell execution_count=35}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nurlData has 11 rows and 4 columns.\n['Bangor', '18808', '53.228', '-4.128']\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo you that might look a lot _worse_ that the data that you originally had, but to a computer that list-of-lists is something it can work with; check it out:\n\n::: {#96390e6a .cell execution_count=36}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfor u in urlData[1:6]: # For each row in the first 5 items in list\n    print(f\"The city of '{u[0]}' has a population of {int(u[1]):,}\") # Print out the name and pop\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe city of 'Perth' has a population of 45,770\nThe city of 'Armagh' has a population of 14,777\nThe city of 'Dundee' has a population of 147,268\nThe city of 'Colchester' has a population of 194,706\nThe city of 'Salisbury' has a population of 40,302\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\nWhy did I use `urlData[1:]` instead of `urlData`?\n\nIf you print `urlData[0]` you'll see that this is the 'header' row that tells us what each column contains! So if we try to convert the column name to an integer (`int(u[1])`) we will get an error!\n\nThe advantage of using the `csv` library over plain old `string.split` is that the csv library knows how to deal with fields that contain commas (_e.g._ `\"Cardfiff, Caerdydd\"` or `\"An Amazing 4 Bedroom Home, Central London, Sleeps 12\"`) and so is much more flexible and consistent that our naive `split` approach. The vast majority of _common_ tasks (reading certain types of files, getting remote files, etc.) have libraries that do exactly what you want without you needing to write much code yourself to take advantage of it. You should always have a look around online to see if a library exists before thinking that you need to write everything/anything from scratch. The tricky part is knowing what words to use for your search and how to read the answers that you find...\n\n:::\n\nLet's try this with a 'bigger' data set... In an ideal world, the 'power' of code is that once we've solved the problem *once*, we've solved it more generally as well. So let's try with the 'scaled-up' data set and see waht happens!\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\nimport csv\n\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jreades/fsds/master/data/src/Wikipedia-Cities.csv\"\nresponse = urlopen(url)\nraw = response.read()\n\ncsvfile = csv.reader(raw.decode('utf-8').splitlines())\n\nurlData = [] # Somewhere to store the data\n\nfor row in csvfile:              \n    urlData.append( row )\n\nprint(f\"urlData has {len(urlData)} rows and {len(urlData[0])} columns.\")\n\nfor u in urlData[70:]:  # For each row in the list\n    print(f\"The city of '{u[0]}' has a population of {u[1]}\") # Print out the name and pop\n```\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### What mistake have I made here?\n\nI have assumed that, just because the files have similar names, they must also have similar layouts!\n\n::: {#4d372386 .cell execution_count=37}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(f\"The URL's data labels are: {', '.join(urlData[0])}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe URL's data labels are: City, Population, Latitude, Longitude\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## Insight!\n\nSo, although the code was basically the same for both of these files (good), we would need to change quite a bit in order to print out the _same_ information from different versions of the _same data_. So our code is rather **brittle**.\n\nOne of the issues is that our _instincts_ about how to manage data doesn't align with how the computer can most _efficiently_ manage it. We make the mistake of thinking that the computer needs to do things that same way that we do when reading text and so assume that we need to:\n\n1. Represent the rows as a list.\n2. Represent the columns as a list for each row.\n\nThis thinking suggests that the 'right' data structure would clearly be a list-of-lists (LoLs!), but if you understand what happened here then the next section will make a _lot_ more sense!\n\n# Why 'Obvious' is Not Always 'Right'\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n#### &#128279; Connections\n\nThis section builds on the material covered by the [DOLs to Data](https://jreades.github.io/fsds/sessions/week3.html#lectures) lecture.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: Hard.\n\n:::\n\nBut you need to be careful assuming that, just because something is hard for you to read, it's also hard for a computer to read! The way a computer 'thinks' and the way that we think doesn't always line up naturally. Experienced programmers can think their way _around_ a problem by working _with_ the computer, rather than against it.\n\nSome issues to consider:\n\n- Is the first row of data _actually_ data, or is it _about_ data?\n- Do we really care about column _order_, or do we just care about being able to pick the _correct_ column?\n\nLet's apply this approach to the parsing of our data...\n\n## Understanding What's an 'Appropriate' Data Structure\n\nIf you stop to think about it, then our list-of-lists approach to the data isn't very easy to navigate. Notice that if the position or name of a column changes then we need to change our program _every_ time we re-run it! It's not very easy to read *either* since we don't really know what `u[5]` is supposed to be. That way lies all kinds of potential errors!\n\nAlso consider that, in order to calculate out even a simple aggregate such as the `sum` of a field for all rows we need to step through a lot of irrelevant data as well: we have to write a `for` loop and then step through each row with an 'accumulator' (somewhere to store the total). That's slow. \n\nThat doesn't make much sense since this should all be _easier_ and _faster_ in Python than in Excel, but right now it's _harder_, and quite possibly _slower_ as well! So how does the experienced programmer get around this? 'Simple' (i.e. neither simple, nor obvious, until you know the answer): she realises that the data is organised the wrong way! We humans tend to think in rows of data: this apartment has the following _attributes_ (price, location, etc.), or that city has the following _attributes_ (population, location). We read across the row because that's the easiest way for *us* to think about it. But, in short, a list-of-lists does _not_ seem to be the right way to store this data!\n\nCrucially, a computer doesn't have to work that way. For a computer, it's as easy to read _down_ a column as it is to read _across_ a row. **In fact, it's easier**, because each column has the same _type_ of data: one column contains names (strings), another column contains prices (integers), and other columns contain other types of data (floats, etc.). Better still, the order of the columns often doesn't matter as long as we know what the columns are called: it's easier to ask for the 'description column' than it is to ask for the 6th column since, for all we know, the description column might be in a different place for different files but they are all (relatively) likely to use the 'description' label for the column itself.\n\n### A Dictionary of Lists to the Rescue\n\nSo, if we don't care about column order, only row order, then a dictionary of lists would be a nice way to handle things. And why should we care about column order? With our CSV files above we already saw what a pain it was to fix things when the layout of the columns changed from one data set to the next. If, instead, we can just reference the 'description' column then it doesn't matter where that column actually is. Why is that? \n\nWell, here are the first four rows of data from a list-of-lists for city sizes:\n\n```python\nmyData = [\n  ['id', 'Name', 'Rank', 'Longitude', 'Latitude', 'Population'], \n  ['1', 'Greater London', '1', '-18162.92767', '6711153.709', '9787426'], \n  ['2', 'Greater Manchester', '2', '-251761.802', '7073067.458', '2553379'], \n  ['3', 'West Midlands', '3', '-210635.2396', '6878950.083', '2440986']\n]\n```\n\nNow, here's how it would look as a dictionary of lists organised by _column_, and _not_ by row:\n\n::: {#ec59fa96 .cell execution_count=38}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmyData = {\n    'id'         : [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    'Name'       : ['London', 'Manchester', 'Birmingham','Edinburgh','Inverness','Lerwick'],\n    'Rank'       : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],\n    'Longitude'  : [-0.128, -2.245, -1.903, -3.189, -4.223, -1.145],\n    'Latitude'   : [51.507, 53.479, 52.480, 55.953, 57.478, 60.155],\n    'Population' : [9787426, 2705000, 1141816, 901455, 70000, 6958],\n}\n\nprint(myData['Name'])\nprint(myData['Population'])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n['London', 'Manchester', 'Birmingham', 'Edinburgh', 'Inverness', 'Lerwick']\n[9787426, 2705000, 1141816, 901455, 70000, 6958]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat does this do better? Well, for starters, we know that everything in the 'Name' column will be a string, and that everything in the 'Longitude' column is a float, while the 'Population' column contains integers. So that's made life easier already, but the real benefit is coming up...\n\n### Behold the Power of the DoL\n\nNow let's look at what you can do with this... but first we need to import one _more_ package that you're going to see a _lot_ over the rest of term: `numpy` (Numerical Python), which is used _so_ much that most people simply refer to it as `np`. This is a _huge_ package in terms of features, but right now we're interested only in the basic arithmatic functions: `mean`, `max`, and `min`.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### We'll step through most of these in detail below.\n\n:::\n\nFind the latitude of Manchester:\n\n::: {#ed346aa1 .cell execution_count=39}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncity = \"Manchester\"\nlat = myData['Latitude'][ myData['Name'].index(city) ]\nprint(f\"{city}'s latitude is {lat}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nManchester's latitude is 53.479\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPrint the location of Lerwick:\n\n:::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\n```python\ncity = \"Lerwick\"\nprint(f\"The town of {city} can be found at \" + \n      f\"{abs(myData[??][ ?? ])}ºW, {myData['Latitude'][ ?? ]}ºN\")\n```\n\n#### Answer\n\n::: {#c94f274b .cell execution_count=40}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncity = \"Lerwick\"\nprint(f\"The town of {city} can be found at \" + \n      f\"{abs(myData['Longitude'][myData['Name'].index(city)])}ºW, {myData['Latitude'][myData['Name'].index(city)]}ºN\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe town of Lerwick can be found at 1.145ºW, 60.155ºN\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\nFind the easternmost city:\n\n:::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\n```python\ncity = myData['Name'][ myData[??].index( max(myData[??]) ) ]\nprint(f\"The easternmost city is: {city}\")\n```\n\n#### Answer\n\n::: {#d23b9770 .cell execution_count=41}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncity = myData['Name'][ myData['Longitude'].index( max(myData['Longitude']) ) ]\nprint(f\"The easternmost city is: {city}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe easternmost city is: London\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\nFind the `mean` population of the cities using a handy package called numpy:\n\n::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\n```python \nimport numpy as np\nmean = np.??(myData['Population'])\nprint(f\"The mean population is: {mean}\")\n```\n\n#### Answer\n\n::: {#f066fc4b .cell execution_count=42}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nmean = np.mean(myData['Population'])\nprint(f\"The mean population is: {mean}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe mean population is: 2435442.5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\n**Stop!** Look closely at what is going on. There's a _lot_ of content to process in the code above, so do _not_ rush blindly on if this is confusing. Try pulling it apart into pieces and then reassemble it. Start with the bits that you understand and then *add* complexity.\n\n:::\n\nWe'll go through each one in turn, but they nearly all work in the same way and the really key thing is that you'll notice that we no longer have any loops (which are slow) just `index` or `np.<function>` (which is _very_ fast). \n\n### The Population of Manchester\n\nThe code can look pretty daunting, so let's break it down into two parts. What would you get if you ran just this code?\n\n::: {#6e77b1cc .cell execution_count=43}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmyData['Population'][1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=43}\n```\n2705000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nRemember that this is a dictionary-of-lists (DoL). So, Python first looks for a key named `Population` in the myData dictionary. It finds out that the value associated with this key is a _list_ and in this example, it just pulls out the second value (index `1`). Does **that part** make sense?\n\nNow, to the second part:\n\n::: {#0dcc0596 .cell execution_count=45}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmyData['Name'].index('Manchester')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=45}\n```\n1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere we look in the dictionary for the key `Name` and find that that's _also_ a list. All we're doing here is asking Python to find the index of 'Manchester' for us in that list. And `myData['Name'].index('Manchester')` gives us back a `1`, so _instead_ of just writing `myData['Population'][1]` we can replace the `1` with `myData['Name'].index('Manchester')`! Crucially, notice the complete _absence_ of a for loop?\n\nDoes that make sense? If it does then you should be having a kind of an &#129327; moment because what we've done by taking a column view, rather than a row view, is to make Python's `index()` command do the work for us. Instead of having to look through each row for a field that matches 'Name' and then check to see if it's 'Manchester', we've pointed Python at the right column immediately and asked it to find the match (which it can do very quickly). Once we have a match then we _also_ have the row number to go and do the lookup in the 'Population' column because the index _is_ the row number!\n\n### The Easternmost City\n\nWhere this approach really comes into its own is on problems that involve maths. To figure out the easternmost city in this list we need to find the _maximum_ Longitude and then use _that_ value to look up the city name. So let's do the same process of pulling this apart into two steps. Let start with the easier bit:\n\n::: {#430f0d61 .cell execution_count=46}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmyData['Name'][0]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=46}\n```\n'London'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat would give us the name of a city, but we don't just want the first city in the list, we want the one with the maximum longitude. To achieve _that_ we need to somehow replace the `0` with the _**index of the maximum longitude**_. Let's break this down further: \n\n1. We first need to _find_ the maximum longitude.\n2. We then need to _find_ the **index** of that maximum longitude.\n\nSo Step 1 would be:\n\n::: {#d7627566 .cell execution_count=47}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmax_lon = max(myData['Longitude'])\n```\n:::\n\n\nBecause the `max(...)` helps us to find the maximum longitude in the Longitude list. Now that we have that we can proceed to Step 2:\n\n::: {#7dbb8450 .cell execution_count=48}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmyData['Longitude'].index(max_lon)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=48}\n```\n0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo now we ask Python to find the position of `max_lon` in the list. But rather than doing this in two steps we can combine into one if we write it down to make it easier to read:\n\n::: {#a35691bd .cell execution_count=49}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmyData['Longitude'].index(\n    max(myData['Longitude'])\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=49}\n```\n0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere's the same `.index` which tells us that Python is going to look for something in the list associated with the `Longitude` key. All we've done is change what's _inside_ that index function to `max(myData['Longitude'])`. This is telling Python to find the _maximum_ value in the `myData['Longitude']` list. So to explain this in three steps, what we're doing is:\n\n- Finding the maximum value in the Longitude column (we know there must be one, but we don't know what it is!),\n- Finding the index (position) of that maximum value in the Longitude column (now that we know what the value is!),\n- Using that index to read a value out of the Name column.\n\nI _am_ a geek, but that's pretty cool, right? In one line of code we managed to quickly find out where the data we needed was even though it involved three discrete steps. Think about how much work you'd have to do if you were still thinking in _rows_, not _columns_!\n\n### The Location of Lerwick\n\nLerwick is a small town in [the Shetlands](https://www.shetland.org/), way up to the North of mainland U.K. and somewhere I've wanted to go ever since I got back from [Orkney](https://www.orkney.com/)--but then I spent my honeymoon in the far North of [Iceland](https://www.westfjords.is/), so perhaps I just don't like being around lots of people... 🙃\n\nAnyway, this one _might_ be a tiny bit easier conceptually than the other problems, except that I've deliberately used a slightly different way of showing the output that might be confusing:\n\nPrint the location of Lerwick:\n\n::: {#955074d9 .cell execution_count=50}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncity = \"Lerwick\"\nprint(f\"The town of {city} can be found at \" + \n      f\"{abs(myData['Longitude'][myData['Name'].index(city)])}ºW, {myData['Latitude'][myData['Name'].index(city)]}ºN\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe town of Lerwick can be found at 1.145ºW, 60.155ºN\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe first thing to do is to pull apart the `print` statement: you can see that this is actually just two 'f-strings' joined by a `+`--having that at the end of the line tells Python that it should carry on to the next line. That's a handy way to make your code a little easier to read. If you're creating a list and it's getting a little long, then you can also continue a line using a `,` as well!\n\n#### 1. The first f-string\n   \nThe first string will help you to make sense of the second: f-strings allow you to 'interpolate' a variable into a string directly rather than having to have lots of `str(x) + \" some text \" + str(y)`. You can write `f\"{x} some text {y}\"` and Python will automatically convert the variables `x` and `y` to strings and replace `{x}` with the _value of `x`_ and `{y}` with the _value of `y`_. \n\nSo here `f\"The town of {city} can be found at \"` becomes `f\"The town of Lerwick can be found at \"` because `{city}` is replaced by the value of the variable `city`. This makes for code that is easier for humans to read and so I'd consider that a good thing.\n\n#### 2. The second f-string\nThis one is hard because there's just a _lot_ of code there. But, again, if we start with what we recognise that it gets just a little bit more manageable... Also, it stands to reason that the only difference between the two outputs is that one asks for the 'Longitude' and the other for the 'Latitude'. So if you can make sense of one you have _automatically_ made sense of the other and don't need to work it all out.\n\nLet's start with a part that you might recognise:\n\n::: {#e54fc560 .cell execution_count=51}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmyData['Name'].index(city)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=51}\n```\n5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou've _got_ this. This is just asking Python to work out the index of Lerwick (because `city = 'Lerwick'`). So it's a number. 5 in this case. And we can then think, 'OK so what does this return:\n\n::: {#fab23156 .cell execution_count=52}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmyData['Longitude'][5]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=52}\n```\n-1.145\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAnd the answer is `-1.145`. That's the Longitude of Lerwick! There's just _one_ last thing: notice that we're talking about degrees West here. So the answer isn't a negative (because negative West degrees would be _East_!), it's the _absolute_ value. And that is the final piece of the puzzle: `abs(...)` gives us the absolute value of a number!\n\n::: {#5c63adea .cell execution_count=54}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nhelp(abs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nHelp on built-in function abs in module builtins:\n\nabs(x, /)\n    Return the absolute value of the argument.\n\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The Average City Size\n\nHere we're going to 'cheat' a little bit: rather than writing our own function, we're going to import a package and use someone _else's_ function. The `numpy` package contains a _lot_ of useful functions that we can call on (if you don't believe me, add \"`dir(np)`\" on a new line after the `import` statement), and one of them calculates the average of a list or array of data.\n\n::: {#d7d97670 .cell execution_count=55}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(f\"The mean population is {np.mean(myData['Population'])}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe mean population is 2435442.5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is where our new approach really comes into its own: because all of the population data is in one place (a.k.a. a _series_ or column), we can just throw the whole list into the `np.mean` function rather than having to use all of those convoluted loops and counters. Simples, right? \n\nNo, not _simple_ at all, but we've come up with a way to _make_ it simple.\n\n### Recap!\n\nSo the _really_ clever bit in all of this isn't switching from a list-of-lists to a dictionary-of-lists, it's recognising that the dictionary-of-lists is a _better_ way to work _with_ the data that we're trying to analyse and that that there are useful functions that we can exploit to do the heavy lifting for us. Simply by changing the way that we stored the data in a 'data structure' (i.e. complex arrangement of lists, dictionaries, and variables) we were able to do away with lots of for loops and counters and conditions, and reduce many difficult operations to something that could be done on one line! \n\n## Brain Teaser\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n\n#### Difficulty: &#129327;.\n\n:::\n\nWhy not have a stab at writing the code to print out the _4th most populous_ city? This can _still_ be done on one line, though you might want to start by breaking the problem down:\n\n1. How do I find the _4th_ largest value in a list?\n2. How do I find the _index_ of the 4th largest value in a list?\n3. How do I use that to look up the name associated with that index?\n\nYou've already done \\#2 and \\#3 above so you've _solved_ that problem. If you can solve \\#1 then the rest should fall into place.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nYou don't want to use `<list>.sort()` because that will sort your data *in place* and break the link between the indexes across the 'columns'; you want to research the function `sorted(<list>)` where `<list>` is the variable that holds your data and `sorted(...)` just returns whatever you pass it in a sorted order *without* changing the original list. You'll see why this matters if you get the answer... otherwise, wait a few days for the answers to post.\n\n:::\n\n:::: {.qna}\n\n#### Question\n\n```python\n# Print out the name of the 4th most populous city-region\ncity = ??\n\nprint(\"The fourth most populous city is: \" + str(city))\n```\n\n#### Answer\n\n::: {#0fea3e97 .cell execution_count=56}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Print out the name of the 4th most populous city-region\ncity = myData['Name'][\n    myData['Population'].index(sorted(myData['Population'], reverse=True)[3])\n]\n\nprint(\"The fourth most populous city is: \" + str(city))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe fourth most populous city is: Edinburgh\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\nThe answer is Edinburgh.\n\n\n## Bringing it all together...\n\nConceptually, this is one of the hardest practicals in the entire term because it joins up so many of the seemingly simple ideas that you covered in Code Camp into a very complex 'stew' -- all our basic ingredients (lists, dictionaries, etc.) have simmered for a bit, been stirred up together, and become something entirely new and more complex.\n\nSo if this practical doesn't make sense to you on the _first_ runthrough, I'd suggest going back through the second half of the practical _again_ in a couple of days' time -- that will give your brain a little time to wrap itself around the basics before you throw the hard stuff at it again. _Don't_ panic if it doesn't all make sense on the _second_ runthrough either -- this is like a language, you need to practice! With luck, the second time you went through this code a little bit _more_ made sense. If you need to do it a third time you'll find that even _more_ makes sense... and so on. \n\n---\njupyter:\n  kernelspec:\n    display_name: Python 3 (ipykernel)\n    language: python\n    name: python3\n    path: /Users/jreades/anaconda3/envs/sds/share/jupyter/kernels/python3\n  language_info:\n    codemirror_mode:\n      name: ipython\n      version: 3\n    file_extension: .py\n    mimetype: text/x-python\n    name: python\n    nbconvert_exporter: python\n    pygments_lexer: ipython3\n    version: 3.12.2\n---\n",
