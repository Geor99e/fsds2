# Getting Started

In order to get you started on your data science 'journey' you will need to follow the guidance provided on the pages we've linked to below from the [CASA Computing Environment](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/) web site.

## Requirements {#sec-requirements}

Before trying to do anything else please complete the basic [health check](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/req/health.html), which also includes our *recommendations* if you are considering buying a new computer when you start your studies. Once you know that your machine and operating system are up-to-date, you should install the [basic utilities](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/req/base.html) that will enable you to complete installation of the programming environment. We also provide information about [Code Camp](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/req/code_camp.html) which is a self-paced introduction to the fundamentals of programming in Python.

## Setup

Once you've ticked off the Requirements, you can start installing the tools that you will use to write and run both code and documentation. You will find it simplest to follow the [Install 'Fest' Guidance](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/setup/install_fest.html).

### When Installation Fails

In an **emergency**, some of the earlier material in the module will work with the ['no install' option](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/setup/no_install.html) or [Anaconda Python](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/setup/env.html#anaconda-python), but this will make your life significantly harder. We are unable to provide support for these.

## Soft Skills

Over the years, based on student experience and feedback we have collected a range of advice that is not purely technical in nature. This section covers [managing distractions](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/skills/attention.html), an introduction to [how to read](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/skills/reading.html) (in the academic sense of reading journal articles and books for *meaning* and *relevance*) as well as [how to think](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/skills/thinking.html) (in the sense of why the modules are the way they are and the importance of reflection), and [how to ask for help](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/skills/help.html) (because that's what we're to do, but first you need to help yourself!).
