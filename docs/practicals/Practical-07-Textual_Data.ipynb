I would normally consider the regexes here a 'first pass' at the data, but would look very carefully at the output of the TF/IDF vectorizer, Count vectorizer, and LDA to see if I could improve my regexes for further cycles of analysis... the main gain there is that regexes are _much_ faster than using the full NLP (Natural Language Processing) pipeline on the _full_ data set each time. As an alternative, you could develop the pipeline using a random subsample of the data and then process the remaining records sequentially -- in this context there is no justification for doing that, but with a larger corpus it might make sense."
